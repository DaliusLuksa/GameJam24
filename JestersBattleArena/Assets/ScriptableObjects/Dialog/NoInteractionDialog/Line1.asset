  text: As the exchange with the town people unfolds, a weariness settles over me.
    My mind, now burdened with the weight of words, yearns for the simplicity of
    action. The clashing of swords and the adrenaline-fueled dance of battle become
    a tantalizing refrain, drowning out the fatigue of endless conversation. It's
    in the arena, amid the clash of steel, that clarity and purpose await.
